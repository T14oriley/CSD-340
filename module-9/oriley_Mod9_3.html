            There are many movies I have enjoyed watching over the years. I can confidently say I am more inclined towards the fantasy genre.
            Outside of fantasy, the movie <span id = "Twister">_________</span> will always hold a special place in my heart.
            Doing <span id = "Meteorology">_________</span> in college further cemented the film as one of my all time favorites.

            Video games have always been present in my life from the young age of <span id = "five">_________</span> to present day.
            One of my most beloved games is <span id = "Kingdom Hearts">_________</span> and I find myself replaying it every other year.
            I believe everyone should play at least one game in their life to see how fun they can be.

            My favorite hobby when I find time is to make candles. I find the activity to be very calming and the scents I can produce make it well worth it.
            The tedious part of this task is the waiting times involved. One candle can take about thirty minutes to make and involves a lot of waiting
            and watching. the end result is always worth it and I love making them as christmas gifts.
