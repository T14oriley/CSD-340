    <p class="intro" >
        My name is Tyler O'Riley and I am a student in this course. 
        <span class="sentence">I grew up near Indianapolis and currently work at PNC Bank. </span>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and watching movies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Software Engineering has been a topic I have been interested in for a long time.
        I initially went to school for Meteorology and GIS and graduated with a bachelors in Geography.
        My goal after this education is to start looking for a new career outside of banking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of school and work, one of my favorite hobbies is candle making.
        I picked up this interest as a christmas idea one year during college.
        Since then I do my best to practice when I have time and I sell them at my mom's craft fair booths.
